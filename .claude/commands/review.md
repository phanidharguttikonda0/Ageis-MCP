# /review

Security, quality, dependency health, accessibility review + test generation. Every finding becomes a GitHub Issue. Powered by `codebase` project intelligence.

Branch: `develop` for read-only review. For `--fix`: use a `fix/<slug>` branch → PR → merge to develop.

## Arguments

```
$ARGUMENTS
```

- `--security` — OWASP top 10, dependency CVEs, secrets in code, auth/authz
- `--quality` — convention adherence (CLAUDE.md), dead code, lint, complexity, duplication
- `--deps` — outdated/vulnerable packages, suggest updates
- `--ui` — accessibility (contrast, ARIA, keyboard nav), responsive issues
- `--test` — generate and run persistent test suites for untested code
- `--test --unit` / `--integration` / `--e2e` / `--coverage` / `--for "feature"` — test scope
- `--pr N` — scope review to changes in PR #N
- `--fix` — auto-fix fixable quality, deps, UI issues, commit to develop
- *(no flags)* — runs all: security + quality + deps + ui

---

## Prerequisites

```bash
gh auth status || { echo "ERROR: gh auth login first."; exit 1; }
git remote get-url origin || { echo "ERROR: No git remote."; exit 1; }
```

### Load codebase project intelligence

```bash
npx codebase brief 2>/dev/null > /tmp/cb-brief.json || true
```

Read the brief. Extract and use throughout:
- `stack.languages`, `stack.frameworks` — language-specific review rules
- `dependencies.notable`, `dependencies.direct_count` — dependency surface
- `quality.linter`, `quality.formatter`, `quality.test_framework` — tooling
- `quality.pre_commit_hooks` — hook coverage
- `patterns.architecture`, `patterns.api_style` — architecture context
- `config.env_vars` — identify secrets/sensitive config exposure

Read `CLAUDE.md` if present — conventions drive the quality dimension.
Read `docs/PRODUCT.md` if present — product context informs security review (roles, auth model, data sensitivity).

### Ensure `review` label exists

```bash
gh label create "review" --color "6f42c1" --description "From a /review audit" 2>/dev/null || true
```

## Review Workflow

Follow the complete `/vb-review` workflow across all phases:

- **Phase 0** — Scope (`--pr N` → graph blast-radius; otherwise full codebase)
- **Phase 1** — Security Review (OWASP top 10, CVEs, secrets, auth/authz)
- **Phase 2** — Quality Review (CLAUDE.md conventions, dead code, lint, complexity, defensive programming, minimal code)
- **Phase 2b** — Dead Code Declutter (graph-aware — uses shared `.codebase/graph.json` first, falls back to `/py-declutter` / `/nextjs-declutter` if graph absent)
- **Phase 3** — Dependency Health (outdated, vulnerable, alternatives)
- **Phase 4** — UI/Accessibility (contrast, ARIA, keyboard, responsive)
- **Phase 5** — Consolidate & prioritize (enrich issue bodies with blast-radius data)
- **Phase 6** — Create GitHub Issues (one per finding, labeled `review,[severity],[dimension]`)
- **Phase 7** — Auto-fix (if `--fix`) + commit (validate blast radius before committing)
- **Phase 8** — Summary

### codebase integration points

**Use brief data to skip re-scanning what codebase already knows:**

```bash
# Instead of re-detecting test framework:
TEST_FRAMEWORK=$(node -e "try{const b=require('/tmp/cb-brief.json');console.log(b.quality?.test_framework||'')}catch{}" 2>/dev/null)

# Instead of re-detecting linter:
LINTER=$(node -e "try{const b=require('/tmp/cb-brief.json');console.log(b.quality?.linter||'')}catch{}" 2>/dev/null)

# Get dependency count for scope estimate:
DEPS=$(node -e "try{const b=require('/tmp/cb-brief.json');console.log(b.dependencies?.direct_count||0)}catch{}" 2>/dev/null)

# Check if graph is available:
GRAPH_AVAILABLE=$(node -e "try{const b=require('/tmp/cb-brief.json');console.log(b.graph?.available?'yes':'no')}catch{console.log('no')}" 2>/dev/null)
```

**Graph-aware Phase 0 scoping (when `--pr N` is supplied):**

If `GRAPH_AVAILABLE=yes`, call the `get_review_context` MCP tool (or `get_impact_radius`) to compute the blast radius:

```
call get_review_context { pr: N, token_budget: 20000 }
```

This returns a `{ files, total_tokens, impact }` object. Use the returned file list as the review scope for Phases 1–4 rather than the full codebase. Log the scope reduction in the scope banner (e.g. "Scoped to 12 files via graph blast-radius (was ~300)").

If `GRAPH_AVAILABLE=no`, fall back to the full codebase review as before. Optionally suggest: "Run `codebase graph build` to enable blast-radius scoping in future reviews."

**Graph-aware Phase 2b (dead-code declutter):**

If `GRAPH_AVAILABLE=yes`, use `query_graph { kind: "entrypoints" }` to get all reachable entry points, then check which files/symbols have no inbound edges (callers=0, not an entrypoint, not a test). These are dead-code candidates. Confirm unreachability with `get_impact_radius` for each candidate.

This replaces the one-shot per-skill graph build — the shared graph is already built and accurate. After analysis, still emit findings via the same GitHub Issues flow (labeled `review,quality,dead-code`). If the graph is absent, fall back to the existing `/py-declutter` / `/nextjs-declutter` skill dispatch.

**Graph-enriched Phase 5 (issue bodies):**

When creating GitHub Issues for findings, include blast-radius context if graph is available:

```
## Impact
- Downstream callers: N files
- Covering tests: [list or "none"]
- Risk score: X/100
```

Fetch this via `get_impact_radius { files: ["<changed file>"] }` before creating the issue.

**Graph safety rail in Phase 7 (auto-fix):**

Before committing a `--fix` branch, run:
```
call get_impact_radius { files: ["<files you edited>"] }
```
If `direct_callers` contains files **outside** the current fix scope, abort auto-fix for that finding and create an issue instead — flag it as "requires manual review: editing this file affects N callers outside scope". This prevents silent breakage of callers the AI didn't inspect.

**Issue creation** — after creating a GitHub Issue, also track in codebase:
```bash
npx codebase issue create "[title]" --message "[body summary]" 2>/dev/null || true
npx codebase scan-only --incremental --quiet --sync
```

**Pre-work sync:**
```bash
git fetch origin
git status  # abort if dirty
git checkout develop && git pull origin develop
```

**Commit convention (if `--fix`):**

For each finding, use an isolated branch:
```bash
SLUG=$(echo "[finding title]" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | tr ' ' '-' | tr -cd 'a-z0-9-' | cut -c1-40)
git checkout -b fix/${SLUG}

git add [specific files only]
git commit -m "fix([dim]): [short description]

/review --fix | Severity: [sev] | Dimension: [dim]
Closes #[N]"
git push origin fix/${SLUG}

gh pr create \
  --base develop \
  --head fix/${SLUG} \
  --title "fix(#[N]): [short description]" \
  --body "## Finding
[description]

## Fix
[what was changed]

Severity: [sev] | Closes #[N]"
```

After PR merge: `git checkout develop && git pull origin develop && git branch -d fix/${SLUG}`

Print scope banner:
```
REVIEW SCOPE
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Project:       [name from brief]
Stack:         [frameworks from brief]
Source files:  [N]
Dependencies:  [direct_count from brief]
Test framework:[quality.test_framework]
Linter:        [quality.linter]
Dimensions:    [security | quality | ui | all]
Auto-fix:      [yes | no]
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

All other behavior (security agent prompts, CVE research, accessibility checks, test generation) follows the `/vb-review` specification exactly.

## Phase 2b — Dead Code Declutter (Stack-Aware)

After the quality review, detect the project stack from the brief and run the appropriate declutter skill if installed. This is automatic — no flags needed.

### Detection logic

```bash
# Read stack from brief (already loaded in Phase 0)
LANGUAGES=$(node -e "try{const b=require('/tmp/cb-brief.json');console.log((b.stack?.languages||[]).join(','))}catch{}" 2>/dev/null)
FRAMEWORKS=$(node -e "try{const b=require('/tmp/cb-brief.json');console.log((b.stack?.frameworks||[]).join(','))}catch{}" 2>/dev/null)
```

### Dispatch rules

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| `LANGUAGES` contains `python` | Run `/py-declutter` |
| `FRAMEWORKS` contains `next` or `nextjs` | Run `/nextjs-declutter` |
| Both match | Run both sequentially (Python first, then Next.js) |
| Neither matches | Skip Phase 2b — log: "No declutter skill matches this stack" |

### Execution

When a matching skill is detected:
1. Call `list_skills` via MCP (or `codebase skills` via bash) to confirm the skill is installed
2. Read the skill's SKILL.md to understand its workflow (the skill file is at `~/.claude/skills/<name>.skill`)
3. Follow the workflow defined in SKILL.md using the tools available in the /review context (Agent, Bash, Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep)
4. For Python skills: run the analysis scripts via `Bash(python:*)`
5. For Node.js skills: run the analysis scripts via `Bash(node:*)`
6. Findings with confidence <80% are reported as GitHub Issues (labeled `review,quality,dead-code`)
7. Findings with confidence >=80% are auto-removed if `--fix` is active, otherwise reported as issues
8. After the skill completes, include its KPI summary (files removed, lines eliminated, functions cleaned) in the Phase 8 summary

### If skill is not installed

If the matching skill file is not found in `~/.claude/skills/`, log:
```
  Skill [name] not installed — run: codebase setup
```
Then continue to Phase 3. Do not fail the review.

---

## Phase 2 — Quality Review (Extended Rules)

The quality agent must check the following **in addition** to the base `/vb-review` quality rules.

### Defensive Programming

Check every function, method, and handler for:

- **Missing guard clauses** — function body has deep nesting where an early return/throw would flatten it. Flag any function with 3+ levels of nesting that could use guard clauses.
- **Missing input validation at boundaries** — functions that accept external input (API params, user input, env vars, CLI args, file reads) without validating type, range, or presence before use.
- **Unchecked null/undefined** — property access on values that could be null/undefined without a prior check (e.g. `user.name` where `user` could be null).
- **Silent failures** — empty `catch` blocks, `.catch(() => {})`, swallowed errors with no logging or rethrow. Every error boundary must either handle, log, or rethrow.
- **Missing error handling at I/O boundaries** — file reads, network calls, subprocess exec, DB queries with no error handling.
- **Optimistic assumptions** — code that assumes an array is non-empty before indexing, assumes a map key exists before accessing, or assumes an async call always resolves.
- **No fail-fast** — configuration or required env vars read lazily (mid-request) instead of validated at startup, so failures surface late and with poor context.

Severity guide:
- `high` — missing validation on external input, unchecked null on a hot path, silent catch hiding errors
- `medium` — deep nesting fixable with guard clauses, missing fail-fast for config
- `low` — optimistic array/map access in low-risk paths

### Minimal Code

Check for over-engineering and unnecessary complexity:

- **YAGNI violations** — abstractions, interfaces, config options, or generics added for hypothetical future use that have exactly one concrete caller/case today.
- **Premature abstraction** — a helper/utility/class created for code used in only one place. Three similar lines of code is better than a one-use abstraction.
- **Over-parameterization** — functions with options objects or boolean flags that only ever receive the same values. Flags that were never flipped from their default since they were added.
- **Unnecessary indirection** — wrapper functions that do nothing but call another function with the same signature.
- **Dead feature flags** — flags/toggles that are always `true` or always `false` in all environments; can just be removed.
- **Backwards-compatibility shims for internal code** — deprecated aliases, re-exports, or `_unused` renames for code that has no external consumers.
- **Excessive comments explaining obvious code** — comments that restate what the code already says clearly (e.g. `// increment counter` above `count++`). Flag only; do not auto-fix.
- **Over-engineered error messages** — error classes with elaborate hierarchies for a project that throws 2-3 distinct error types.

Severity guide:
- `medium` — YAGNI abstractions, over-parameterization, unnecessary indirection
- `low` — dead flags, excessive comments, minor shims

### Code Simplicity Principles

- **Flat over nested** — prefer early returns, guard clauses, and linear flow over pyramid/callback-hell structures.
- **Explicit over clever** — flag code that uses obscure language tricks, complex one-liners, or metaprogramming where a simple loop/condition would be clearer.
- **Consistent patterns** — same operation done differently in 2+ places (e.g. one place uses `?.` optional chaining, another uses explicit null check for the same pattern). Flag the inconsistency; suggest unifying to the simpler form.
- **Functions do one thing** — flag functions that mix concerns (e.g. validate + transform + persist in one function body >30 lines with no clear single responsibility).

Severity guide:
- `medium` — mixed concerns in large functions, inconsistent patterns across the codebase
- `low` — clever one-liners, minor style inconsistencies

### Auto-fixable vs Architectural

- **Auto-fixable (`--fix`)**: guard clause refactors (simple cases), removing empty catch blocks (replace with `// TODO: handle error`), removing dead flags set to constant values, removing unused re-exports.
- **Architectural (create issue, no auto-fix)**: adding input validation that requires schema/type decisions, restructuring mixed-concern functions, replacing premature abstractions (requires understanding callers).
